## Project Topic Area
**Secure Full-Stack Web Application Development for On-Demand Work Marketplace**

Our project will design and implement a secure full-stack web and mobile application that connects businesses needing short-term workers with individuals seeking flexible, shift-based employment. The platform will emphasize secure authentication, session management, and database security while providing features such as job posting, job searching, real-time notifications, profile management, and document verification. The system will be built using a modern stack (React Native frontend, FastAPI backend, and a cloud-hosted database), ensuring scalability, usability, and compliance with relevant data protection and employment regulations.
